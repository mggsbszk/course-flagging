What will the results be in China? In India? In the Maldives? This course will address the question of planetary consequences of climate change using fiction and film as a means of representing the past and present, and imagining possible futures beyond a US-centered framework. We’ll also have a fair amount of nonfiction reading on this issue -- both scientific accounts that help elucidate the scale of the problem, as well as some accounts that might be understood as climate change skepticism. In addition to thinking carefully about what the data shows and what it doesn’t, it seems important to understand why poorer countries in particular have been slow to sign on to fighting climate change. Readings and films will focus on the experiences of people from the Global South as well as minoritized communities within the U.S. Films will include experimental works and documentaries exploring climate change in India and parts of Africa, along with popular films like ""Don't Look Up"" and ""Snowpiercer.""",Sustainability-inclusive,
English,Interpretation: Critical Theory and Practice,ENGL 309,ENGL,309,All offerings,"This course offers an introduction to literary theory from its origins in ancient Greek philosophy to its more recent iterations in post-structuralism and beyond. Critical theory is essential to helping us understand the value and inner-workings of literary texts and other forms of cultural production. Works of poetry, fiction, and drama do not just reflect the realities of our world, but function to shape those very realities. Our exploration of various critical methodologies, then, will allow us to see how literature informs our thinking about race, class, gender, and other social and political issues. In studying a broad range of philosophical and theoretical thinkers, we will discover how the texts we read invite us to consider, most fundamentally, what it means to be human and how to live ethically in the world.",Sustainability-inclusive,
English,Literary & Cultural Theory,ENGL 312,ENGL,312,All offerings,"Critics, artists, and writers have devoted tremendous time and energy to theorizing modes of resistance to patriarchy, often demonstrating the resiliency of subordinated subjects. We will consider the resiliency of patriarchy as an artificial system that deploys diverse resources to sustain white male supremacy. We will seek to make explicit various patriarchal strategies, including hegemony, controlling powerful or threatening women, affected male desperation, and authoritative masculinity; in addition, we will work to expose the cultural logics that undergird, repurpose, and refuel such strategies. One fundamental goal of our seminar will be to demonstrate how patriarchy is neither natural nor permanent. Our second goal will be to theorize alternatives to patriarchy: how might we overturn white male supremacy, create diverse kinds of communities, relations, and experiences, or imagine new ways of being and becoming? We will draw directly on feminist, queer, and Trans theory, devoting special attention to transformative Black feminists Audre Lorde, Syliva Wynter, and bell hooks. As part of our attempt to theorize alternatives to patriarchy, we will read two examples of contemporary Trans fiction: Lydia Rogue's fantastic collection, Trans-Galactic Bike Ride: Feminist Bicycle Science Fiction Stories and Nonbinary Adventurers (2020) and Akwaeke Emezi's young adult fantasy novel, Pet (2019).

Reading literature from this period, not only provides us with a fascinating account of medical history, but more pressingly, it pushes us to consider how literary studies provides a unique way to understand the complexities, tensions, and ambiguities that come with medical advances. In this work, we will be doing a history of the present: using interdisciplinary humanistic inquiry to understand how we have wrought the biomedical present, in turn, putting into question the very idea of objectivity, the divide between science/art, and the notion that medical progress equates to better health outcomes, access to health care, and social justice.

What can we learn from texts written in an era when, for example, lepers were sentenced to legal death; female mystics could be seen as hysterics; and the sick sought healing not just from doctors, but also from the miraculous interventions of saints? Studying the diverse religious, medical, and social practices of late medieval and early modern England, we will explore how the complex cultures of the premodern past understood the categories of disability and normative identity. Moreover, we will investigate how such categories map onto to larger structures of race, gender, religion, and class. Focusing on historical developments and relevant ethical frameworks, we will also consider how premodern societies responded to and cared for the disabled members of their communities.

Some of the greatest masterpieces of American literature were written within ten years of each other during the mid-19th century: Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, the poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and the powerful accounts of life under slavery by Harriet Jacobs and Frederick Douglass. These and other writers produced a diverse and vibrant body of literature in response to issues facing U.S. citizens in the years leading up to the Civil War.

English,Special Topics in English,ENGL 391,ENGL,391,Specific offerings,"The Rights of Man, Thomas Paine’s classic argument in defense of the individual’s right to assert freedom in the face of tyranny, was a popular late-eighteenth century refrain originating from the 1789 French Revolution. But generalized arguments about individual human rights also gave rise to specific debates concerning the rights of women and Negro slaves. What rights were these individuals denied in eighteenth-century Britain and how did the period’s
literature reflect their dilemmas? This course will consider these questions as a way of introducing you to the study of race and gender in a British colonial context. But it is articularly concerned with occasions in literature where British writers combined simultaneous discourses about race and gender in ways that sometimes helped and at other times hindered the fights against tyranny that Negro slaves and female advocates fought. We will read plays, poetry, novels, short stories, travel literature, and non-fiction prose as well as recent theories
about gender and racial construction in the eighteenth century to discuss representations of British men and women, and colonial Others like Negro slaves, Creoles and Jews. We will consider an assortment of issues ranging from slavery, anti-slavery, abolition, miscegenation, mimicry, ambivalence, hybridity, anti-Semitism, blackness and whiteness, to marriage, libertinism, and sexual double standards in a variety of canonical and obscure texts.

English,Topics In Medieval Literature,ENGL 435,ENGL,435,All offerings,"The ideal of social unity looms large in late medieval discourse which imagines a world harmoniously divided into three, interdependent estates—that of the knightly class, the church, and workers in various trades. And yet, the writings of the medieval period frequently portray conflicts, identities, and ways of being that defy social norms. In addition to challenging economic hierarchies and gender expectations, these texts also question the broader aims and values of living in the world. We will study such writings in this course. Among the topics we will potentially explore are historical episodes of political resistance and religious dissent involving peasant uprisings and the Wycliffite movement, England’s first indigenous heresy. We will also investigate religious traditions that see beggars as manifestations of Christ and that regard enclosure—a “living death”—as a form of Christian perfection. We’ll also encounter legendary figures from both fiction and historical reality. These include, for example, Margery Kempe, a “born again virgin” (and mother of 14), whose mystical visions caused disruptive episodes of crying and roaring, and Henryson’s Criseyde, the unfaithful lover of Troilus, who is stricken with leprosy and sentenced to life on the margins of the community.

But like a growing number of humanities scholars today, you may also aspire to share your knowledge with broader audiences, to collaborate with those outside the university, and to contribute your growing academic expertise to broader movements for social justice. This seminar will introduce you to the theory and practice of the public humanities. You will leave the seminar with an understanding of the methods employed by public humanists and with tools for forging community-based collaborations and developing your writing for broader audiences.
The course opens with a brief overview of the emergence of and current theorizations of the public humanities. We will read debates among scholars about the public turn in the humanities – and we will consider how these practices are being defined and evaluated by major foundations, professional organizations, and public institutions. After setting the theoretical foundation for our work, the bulk of the seminar will introduce students to successful models and methods. You will study the work of distinguished literary critics and other humanities scholars (including faculty and alumni of our graduate program) who are writing for the mainstream press (long-form intellectual journalism, newspaper Op Eds, online venues). You will read inspiring models of literary non-fiction by authors working inside and outside of academia and reaching broad public audiences.

Interdepartmental Arts,Contemporary U.S. Literature of Environmental Crises,EVST 397,EVST,397,Specific offerings,"How does contemporary American literature intervene into debates about environmental crises? How does literature, in form and in content, challenge readers to think differently about human impact on the world? In Lawrence Buell’s pivotal work of literary ecocriticism titled Writing for an Endangered World: Literature, Culture, and Environment in the U.S. and Beyond, he suggests that contemporary environmentalist fiction engages with “toxic discourse,” which he defines as “an expressed anxiety arising from a perceived threat of environmental hazard due to chemical modification by human agency. As such, it is by no means unique to the present day, but never before the late twentieth century has it been so vocal, so intense, so pandemic, so evidentially grounded” (30-31). Following Buell, this course will address contemporary literature that depicts toxic America and the environmental crises as well as the human (and other animal) tragedies that result from a variety of contemporary practices that deny human connectivity to and dependence upon ecosystems. Students can expect to engage with some of the most important novels written in the contemporary period that call readers to address human impact on the environment and to imagine alternative and less ruinous ways of being in the world. This course will be especially valuable for students in the humanities and for students in the environmental sciences that are invested in how literary works provide resources for imagining sustainable futures and inspiring readers to engage with the challenges of the Anthropocene.",Sustainability-focused,

Given that the narrative is based on the real-life events of Jeffrey Dahmer’s life and the killings of his victims, the show received backlash from the families of the victims as well as the general public. In response, our course interrogates the ethics of portraying serial violence in dramatic and repetitive representations. In watching Silence of the Lambs (1991; Orion Pictures), Mindhunter (2017; Netflix), & Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022; Netflix), this course will ask the question, how should the violence of these horrible crimes, often based on real-life events, be portrayed, if at all? What does it mean to queer violent offenders in these dramatized realms? Should the ethos of the storytellers impact our intake as we consider whether the form and iteration of violent offenders is art?

Interdepartmental Arts,Freshman Seminar in Global Studies,GS 090,GS,090,Specific offerings,"When did data, let alone “big data,” become such an important part of how businesses, nations, and individuals make decisions? This seminar takes us back to the first era of big data, which began with the explosion in data collection that occurred in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Advances from the Scientific Revolution–along with imperialist ventures that led to new methods of categorizing people, places, and things–gave rise to the idea that data are not only a source of reliable information, but also a means of shaping society. In this seminar we will seek to understand how the process of describing, collecting, and analyzing information has always been embedded in human culture, from cultural ideas about race and identity influencing the categories in census data to aesthetic ideas about art and literature informing ways that data are communicated and visualized. In addition to exploring the cultural history of data from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, this seminar will also teach students how to read data tables from a variety of sources–from data collected by the nineteenth-century whaling industry to the most up-to-date data on the global problems facing us in the twenty-first century.

One ever feels his two-ness, -an American, a Negro; Two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” (Dr. William Edward Burghardt DuBois 1903 The Souls of Black Folk) In 1903 Dr. William E.B. DuBois named the experiences of the decedents of kidnapped Africans living in America, “double-consciousness.” At the age of 35, the sociologist, historian, Pan-Africanist and author used but two words to explain the struggle of over four million U.S. citizens. DuBois’ term applied questions for women and men of color.

Through a health humanities lens we will study texts from a range of disciplines - medicine, history, bioethics, philosophy, digital humanities, media studies, and fiction - about bodies and embodiment. We will first chart depictions and expectations of the body in the history of medical knowledge, from Ancient Greek anatomical drawings to Victorian grave robbers who sold corpses for research, to Digital visions of the body as a medical object like the Visible Human Project (1994). We will then consider how fiction can illuminate cultural and ethical issues surrounding the body, our shared fears related to the body and selfhood, and issues of social justice, equality, and embodiment.

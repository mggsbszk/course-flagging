During the iHeart radio premier of TTPD, Swift explains that much of the album focuses on “fatalism, longing, pining away, lost dreams” and that it “is a dramatic, artistic, tragic kind of take on love and loss.” Thus, taking our cue from the tortured songstress herself, we will focus on the themes explored in The Tortured Poets Department with an emphasis on understanding art as metaphor and hyperbole for the tragic messiness of love, loss, and erotic desire. From love that feels like an alien abduction that leave us down bad crying at the gym to fatherly disapproval that might have us screaming “But, Daddy, I love him!,” we will delve into the mind of a tortured poet at the height of her career.

Who were the ancestors of modern-day witches, or those who embrace the feminist associations with witchcraft and the occult? Was witchcraft real or was it merely a delusion? What were male witches like and how did they effect the community? This course conceptualizes Western European witchcraft within both a popular and historical framework by retracing its history from the earliest trial records of the early Renaissance to its reclamation as a form of feminine empowerment in the early 20th century. To underscore the popular interest in witchcraft, we will watch three movies and excerpts of one TV show that offer various depictions of the 20th century witch and how she/he has evolved over the centuries.

This course will help students to gain an understanding of the history of Black people in Britain through how they are represented in literature; it will introduce students to the immigrant experience in the UK through food, music, art; specifically, we will explore the Caribbean and its diaspora, paying special attention to the Brixton and Birmingham riots, and the Windrush generation. While the course will provide students with an insight of how Blackness and Britishness are seemingly at odds, it will further explore how migration and migratory experiences have challenged/pushed the literary and geographic boundaries of Britishness. Likely texts include: Paul Gilroy, There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack (accompanied by Ebony Jones’s song No Black in the Union Jack), Andrea Levy, Small Island, Caryl Phillips, The European Tribe and Color Me English, Warsan Shire, Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in her Head, Bernadine Evaristo, Mr. Loverman, and Nadifa Mohammed, Black Mamba Boy.

What are the origins of neurodiversity as both a social movement and an intellectual framework? What can literature tell us about neurodiversity? And what can neurodiversity tell us about literature? In this course we’ll ask these key questions by reading a wide variety of texts focused on the clinical history of autism, fictional autistic characters, autistic experiences, and autistic patterns of language. While we will explore how autism has come to be seen as a pathological disorder, we will also consider alternative approaches to the condition understood as a form of personhood and identity. Working across a variety of disciplines, we will see how autism is fundamentally bound up with acts of representation, imagination, and interpretation—acts that have ethical consequences in shaping our understandings of justice and what it means to be human. Readings will focus on texts such as Steve Silberman’s Neurotribes, Temple Grandin’s Thinking in Pictures, Mark Haddon’s A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, and Tito Mukhopadhyay’s How Can I Talk if My Lips Don’t Move.

202440,fall 2024,45307,ENGL 497-010,,Theorizing Masculinity,"The late nineteenth-century feminist, Sarah Grand, memorably remarked that “man is an exceedingly difficult and delicate subject to approach,” and clarified that “if a woman have anything to say about him that is not altogether flattering, it is necessary to begin by an emphatic qualification of each assertion separately,—such as that it never did and never could apply to men generally, only to individuals.” Grand’s comment captures something of the difficulty of talking about men and masculinity, much less the intellectual work of theorizing masculinity: any claim about men inevitably invites qualification, challenge, or some kind of specification—perhaps even some kind of excuse. This graduate seminar will consider some of the difficulties that Grand’s critique makes clear. We will draw on the work of feminist critical theory to explore the evolving field of masculinity studies. In this process, we will ask questions about gender formation, sexual identity, legacies of racism, patriarchal violence, and the roles of women in sustaining patriarchy. This seminar will make no attempt to offer a comprehensive overview of the field of Masculinity Studies nor will we take up all discussion of men and masculinity. Instead, we will read from prominent and emergent theorists to develop historical and philosophical context and work through a series of full-length texts, including bell hooks’s We Real Cool: Black Men and Masculinity (2004), Mellissa N. Stein’s Measuring Manhood: Race and the Science of Masculinity, 1830-1934 (2015), K. Allison Hammer’s Masculinity in Transition (2023), and Jared Sexton’s Black Masculinity and the Cinema of Policing (2017).

As one of the most appealing writers in the English language, Austen serves as a versatile, dynamic, and perhaps most importantly, unthreatening cultural resource for various people and organizations. She is one of the very few writers who remains thoroughly canonical within the academic study of literature and enjoys a vast popular following outside of the university. And she is (still) one of the hottest writers in Hollywood as well as other global sites of film production.

These can include, but are not limited to, the deep enduring questions that humanity has grappled with for ages or emerging questions of today. Moves to control what the public knows have a long history in most cultures. Bans of individual works serve to extend political control, maintain public “decorum,” protect community values and economic influence, and enforce traditional divisions in society. Censorship keeps books, poems, films, art, performances, even individual phrases and words out of general circulation around the globe. But is censorship necessary? What about our freedom of expression? How do we draw the line between individual rights and the common good? In this course we will look at theories behind censorship and explore twentieth- and twenty-first-century works of cinema, literature, visual art, and music banned around the globe to understand what motivates both the censors and the ingenious dissenters who find and share such “dangerous” material.",M W,XS B001,,-, ,,-, ,18,18,20,872709728,"Nicholas, Mary",MJ,GS 090-010 (44368),Arts & Sciences,,,,,,,

Because debates about gender and sexuality take place across a range of social and political institutions, course readings include legal statutes and cases, penitential manuals, and theological treatises alongside narrative texts in order to offer a nuanced account of race, gender, and sexuality in the Middle Ages. Readings will include The Life of Christina Markyate, Silence, the Legenda Aurea, Marie de France’s Lais, as well as selections from the Canterbury Tales, among others.

202520,summer 2025,21664,HMS 391-010,,Special Topics:Sex Biological?,"What is “sex”? Is it something you are, something your body is, or something else entirely? This course surveys scientific, critical, and literary theories and representations of what we now call “biological sex” alongside the development of sexual health and medicine in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. From Charles Darwin to the mid-century gender clinic, from sexology to modern trans medicine and media, we will close read accounts of sex and sex difference and determine how these texts convey, construct, and analyze sex and its implications within interpersonal, clinical, and global milieus. How did the concept of ""biological sex” develop, and how is it entangled with other forms of embodiment and identity like race, sexuality, and gender? What are the scientific, clinical, and political ramifications of distinguishing sex and gender, and how should sex and gender figure in future medical research? How might past and present health sciences and literature inform, revise, or reject the stories we tell ourselves about our own sexes, genders, and sexualities? In addition to passages from medical textbooks, scientific essays, poems, and memoirs, we will study how feminist, queer, intersex, and trans critics have taken up these questions in both science studies and humanist disciplines. Students will emerge from this course with an intersectional understanding of the history and medicine of sex in the nineteenth century through today and the ability to interrogate literary and scientific depictions and theories of sex within historical and modern contexts; they will also learn and apply theories from within women’s, gender, and sexuality studies. Possible readings include: Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Mary Seacole, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jules Gill-Peterson, and Torrey Peters.",M,ONLINE ,,-, ,,-, ,3,16,16,852057871,"Ferguson, Alexis",ZZ,WGSS 391-010 (21665),Arts & Sciences,,,,,,,

We will read formally experimental literary works of the early 20 th century that transformed the novel and modern poetry, increasing their psychological depth and political ambition. We will consider what these remarkable literary works can teach us about one of the fundamental challenges that each of us must face in life: how to respond to loss, injury and disappointment. Some modernist writers explored the challenge of mourning for intimate, personal losses – such as the failure of a romantic relationship, the death of a loved one, or the disappointment of a personal aspiration. Others were concerned with the collective challenge of grieving for large-scale social injuries and forms of injustice. How did working-class writers mourn for the deprivations entailed by poverty and economic exploitation? What strategies did African American writers create for mourning and flourishing in the face of a long history of racism and oppression? How did women writers in this period grieve for opportunities denied to them – and imagine a transformed society in which women and men might realize their capacities together? We will consider why some writers responded to social injury and loss by withdrawing into despair or scapegoating the most vulnerable members of society, while others participated in movements or social justice. We will read fiction and poetry by Willa Cather, John Dos Passos, T. S. Eliot, Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner, H.D., Ernest Hemingway, Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, William Carlos Williams and others. Students will have opportunities to explore their own experiences of loss and develop strategies for sustaining personal and political hope in challenging times.

How did they espouse the national ideal of freedom in an empire dedicated to slavery? How did they promote social equality in a nation where women were openly considered inferior to men? This course will confront these types of questions as we examine how causes such as poverty, slavery, sexual freedom and feminism were promoted in representative texts from British fiction and philosophy. We will also use this course as an opportunity to investigate whether eighteenth century Britain is an under-utilized space for thinking about the geneses of other contemporary causes associated with social justice. For instance, does the gay marriage discourse owe its genesis to a series of lesbian marriages promoted in eighteenth century fiction and society? Does the Hip Hop Movement owe its genesis to the structural techniques, characterizations and the first use of the term “Hip Hop” in restoration drama? Does the free love movement of the 1960s owe its genesis to a text about sexual freedom banned in 1748?

Our review indicates that this integrative closure for the marketing coursework is a common practice at some of the better business schools. It will focus on how marketing strategy supports the overall corporate strategy. The course will emphasize that Marketing does not operate in vacuum. What is done in other functional areas will impact marketing strategy profoundly, and vice versa. The will address traditional strategic issues such as identification of organizational strengths, weaknesses and environmental opportunities in the context of developing marketing strategies, but will also emphasize the importance of embracing a customer centric orientation throughout the organization. Incorporating a customer centric orientation is an essential component of marketing strategy today as it captures the dynamic and evolving nature of marketing. Every company employee is important to the marketing function, every employee contact with a customer is a form of marketing communication, the increasing number of customer- initiated contacts with the firm are as important as firm-initiated contacts, and customer relationships now take precedence over sales transactions. Specific emphasis will be placed on applying theoretical principles in realistic scenarios by means of case studies of how marketing strategy is impacted by the overall corporate strategy and other functional strategies.

What do the texts teach us about the way the contemporary moment thinks about nature and the world? What kinds of future are imagined in contemporary Chinese fiction? With these questions in mind, students will learn to think beyond our current problematic human-nature relationship. We will closely engage with various forms of speculations about the future, such as projections of catastrophe, visions of a more sustainable society, and conceptualizations of vast and complex planetary systems.

How does the condition of globalization precipitate the transformation of how we visualize and make sense of the world and how does this shift manifest itself in contemporary visual and popular culture? This course addresses these questions by examining a diverse range of forms of visual representations and media, beginning with photography in late Qing and early Republican China, and moving to topics such as cinema in colonial Manchuria, Taiwan and occupied Shanghai, Mao-era photography and film, women’s cinema, documentary photography and performance art in post-Mao China, and Hong Kong and Taiwan cinemas before and during the New Wave.

We will place shows and films including Drag Race, Work in Progress and Paris is Burning alongside gender-bending plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, medieval and early modern trans and nonbinary life-stories, and explorations of gender by a wide range of authors including Miguel de Cervantes, Virginia Woolf, and Octavia Butler.

202510,spring 2025,14830,ENGL 473-010,,Antebellum American Literature,"Between the excess of printed texts made available by recent advances in printing technology and the nation-making tools of census demography, the 19th-century United States had become a culture of data. Data is fundamentally a question of form, and literary theory has taught us that the process of shaping any aspect of the human experience into a recognizable form—whether the form of a sonnet or the form of a spreadsheet—is influenced by the agents and structures of power. The literary texts that we read for this course participated in the 19th-century project of sorting and organizing an excessive amount of information, and they did so by both participating in and modifying conventional literary forms. Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick and Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass are data-rich texts that replace conventional narrative plot and poetic form with alternative methods for arranging and displaying an overwhelming amount of information. Whitman also joined with his contemporary Emily Dickinson in structuring their poetry archives as idiosyncratic collections of biometric data. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin and William Wells Brown’s Clotel explore how African American bodies were subjected to regimes of data quantification that included the 3/5ths compromise of the U.S. Constitution, categories of racial descent (mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, etc.), and the economic structures of plantation slavery.",M,DR 102A,,-, ,,-, ,8,18,18,811143155,"Whitley, Edward",,,Arts & Sciences,,,,,,,

This course explores the policy strategies and international politics of changing climates, environmental degradation, and human-nature relationships. At least two dimensions of diverse dynamics come into view: first, local and transnational environmental processes, from deforestation and forced displacement to biodiversity loss; and second, the political negotiation of changing norms, economic transactions, institutional and diplomatic influence, and energy sources. How will changes to nature and in the nature of power influence an emergent international political order? This is an interdisciplinary course, which means we will draw on ideas, questions, critiques, and methods of investigation and ways of ‘seeing’ and experiencing the universe from many intellectual and creative traditions. These forms of approaching the world include lenses that may be described as anthropological, historical, ethnographic, feminist, and sociological. Nature and place are social forces that shape our experience of world politics. How do we think about and talk about nature and its connection to place? Can making these connections spark memory, belonging, and perhaps exclusion and divisiveness? How do humans’ relationships with/in the natural environment make histories and social relations? Does the human-nature connection reveal insights about how we govern ourselves? Can we reimagine a world in which natural forces and people interact differently? What role have states played in harnessing nature, and how have different human groups responded? The course explores how states, communities, and political organizations experience, exploit, and defend nature. How are natural resources like lands, minerals, water, and air protected and conserved? Do these practices reflect the ways in which individuals and groups value and live in them?",T R,MG 112,,-, ,,-, ,42,40,40,813509725,"Finn, Devin",,,Arts & Sciences,,,,,,,

This is followed by subjecting some (or all) of these principles to a standard anarchistic critique inquiring whether there is a defensible justification for allocating power and authority to certain individuals or groups over the whole community of citizens.

The theatricality of play is most apparent when embodiment is a key component of the playfulness. This course explores human presence as a creative, embodied agent within the “magic circle” of play, focusing on games where the imaginative and narrative capacities of the player are central to the experience. Through embodied storytelling, players navigate conflict and consequence within a space of potentiality. As such, games create the possibility to make meaningful choices that shape both the narrative for characters and the experience for players. These instances of play inhabit entangled realities between the imagined realm of storytelling and the physical expression of performance and material paraphernalia.  This course will explore theatrical manifestations of play such as role-playing games, narrative games, escape rooms, and alternate reality games. Through the study of such games and the theoretical framework of theatrical ludology, students will interrogate the impact of play on the player, engage in collaborative storytelling and creative expression, and apply theories of game studies and theatre in designing play experiences",T R,FM 520,,-, ,,-, ,8,20,20,860183270,"Lowry, William",,,Arts & Sciences,,,,,,,

By law, the individual would be stripped of their possessions and property, their birthright, name, forbidden to talk to uninfected people, appear in town, or touch anything outside the leper colony, except with a rod or stick. The threat of contamination was imminent and the fear it engendered was almost palpable. Those suffering from physical and mental ailments were social pariahs shunned by the community as well as sources of fascination for medical practitioners who sought to dissect and study them. This four-week course looks closely at diseases of the body (bubonic plague, syphilis, smallpox, leprosy) and the mind (melancholy, hysteria, which were often attributed to demonic possession) which shaped premodern European society (roughly 1300-1750) and, through careful study by medical practitioners, led to modern medical advancements.
